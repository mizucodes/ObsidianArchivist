## About

This script is designed to back up an Obsidian Vault and convert all Markdown (`.md`) files into plain text (`.txt`) files. It's a handy tool for ensuring your notes are always accessible and in a universally readable format.

## Setup

Before running the script, please ensure you create a directory named `logs` in the root directory of the script. This directory is essential for storing log files generated by the script.

## Goal Functionality

- **Backup Obsidian Vault**: The script will copy your entire Obsidian Vault to a backup location.
- **Convert Markdown to Text**: All Markdown files within the vault will be converted to plain text files, maintaining the original content and structure.
- **Ignore Configs**: There are a lot of hidden config files, and need a way to ignore them.
- **Speed**: Some vaults with enormus size may be an issue down the road, so optimization is a constant focus.

Further updates are on the way, still in early development.
